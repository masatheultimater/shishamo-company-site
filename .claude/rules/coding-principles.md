# Coding Principles
- Simplicity first: prefer the simplest solution that works
- Single Responsibility: one function = one job
- Early return: reduce nesting, fail fast
- Type hints: always annotate function signatures
- DRY: extract when duplicated 3+ times
- YAGNI: don't build what's not needed yet
